## Ideas

* Notice board
  * Departmental
  * Events
* Class schedule
* Fees payment
* Salary (for staff)
* Send mail??

## Things to ponder

* Should all logic be in one script or they should be split according to function like, canteen.js, login.js? Likewise for css as well.
* Should mail sending facility be added or not?
* Should personal notes and organizer be added for student like a diary or organizer app?
